So we can define the priority $p$ of experience $i$ as TD-error $\\delta$ plus a small number $\\epsilon$(to avoid 0 priority). Alpha, $0 <= \\alpha <= 1$, controls how much prioritization is used. With $\\alpha = 0$, we get uniform sampling. \n",

In typical reinforcement learning scenarios, the unbiased nature of the updates is most important near convergence at the end of training. So we can linearly anneal $\\beta$ from a initial value(I use 0.4 from the paper) to 1 during training. The relevant files are [prioritized_replay_buffer.py](prioritized_replay_buffer.py) and [ddqn_prioritized_agent.py](ddqn_prioritized_agent.py)."
